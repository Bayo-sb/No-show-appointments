# No-show-appointments

This dataset contains information about 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. Each row in the dataset includes various characteristics about the patient, such as the day the appointment was scheduled, the patient's neighborhood, enrollment in the Brazilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia, physical handicap status, patient ID, appointment ID, gender, age, hypertension status, diabetes status, alcoholism status, SMS message receipt, and attendance status. The attendance status is indicated by the 'No-show' column, which indicates whether the patient showed up for their appointment or not.
